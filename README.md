# L8

L8 is an ultra-lightweight PHP based logging system which publishes data directly to a Redis channel.

It can be used as a simple logger supporting 8 different levels complete with custom context, an error handler or an exception handler.
With no dependencies other than PHP and Redis L8 is designed to be easy to use, and provides a high-speed mechanism for pushing logs out of a PHP application with minimal overhead.
